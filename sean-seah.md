I
love
technology.


*All sorts. Gadgets. Phones. Computers. Wearables.*

Over the years, I started out a small blog called GadgetReactor which captures my thoughts and opinions on the latest technology, especially on the Singaporean front. It was fun. Blogging has brought me new opportunities and allowed me to experience the latest gadgets first hand. Along the way, I noticed that certain technology have stagnated, and companies come and go. The death of Nokia is one such example. The lesson from it applies to us as well. We need to stay relevant otherwise we become obsolete.
