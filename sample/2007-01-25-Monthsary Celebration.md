Amidst preparation for FYP and recovering from a mild hangover, I can't missed out on celebrating our one month anniversary or 1st Monthsary.

On the hangover bit, we had started the celebrations a little earlier with friends the night before at St James. I'm really a newbie to the whole clubbing scene and this is my first ever visit to St James. The alcohol was showing its effect on my stomach and didnâ€™t agree totally with whatever I put in. Irritating but was still surviving. Means I had to eat a little less. Helps cut down on my calorie intake after the long night out. 

We already had all the noise the night before, plus I was still feeling quite lousy what with my stomach and the overall tiredness, so we ended up having something light and quiet. We went back to the place where we got together 1 month ago, Delifrance @ Anchorpoint, it's never going to be the same again. She got me such a cute present, the DHS Alumni doll, haha, so symbolic of us in such a way, and a story book that chronicles our well, first moments :). Time really flies, doesn't it, it really emphasize how much we need to seize the moment.

Slightly prior to that, we also celebrated a first of sorts - I first bought her flowers on 21st January 2007 - The Day of Your Driving Test. *While it took her a couple more years and many more tries before she passed, she perservered.*

It was a bouquet of lilies and roses. White lilies are symbolic with purity, virginity, majesty, which were her favourite. A rose by any other name would smell as sweet. 

Yet, roses are like synonymous with love, and even the number of stalks have meanings. Commercialised? Maybe, yet even for a fleeting moment, flowers in bloom are so beautiful.
