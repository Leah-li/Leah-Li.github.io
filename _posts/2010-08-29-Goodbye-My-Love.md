29 August 2014 changed my life forever. I had ended work early that day after an event and was looking forward to the start of the weekend. J was at the 19th week mark and had a long day at work. She was tired but it didn't seem like much initially. She cab home and was resting after dinner. 

She had mild cramps, which we initially dismiss due to tiredness but the intensity grew stronger. It was worrying, and by around 9+, it didn't seem like it was subsiding and we decided to go to the A&E.  As we waited, I could see J suffering in pain as the attacks grew in intensity. We were concerned and managed to get the doctor to attend to her quickly. The initial diagnosis was that it was likely to be a digestive-related problem and that provided some initial relief. But that was just the calm before the storm.

The rest of the night went by in a blur, yet key moments will always be etched in memory. It was a long arduous night. Anguish engulfed me, but staring into the abyss that you were in, made me grew stronger. We will definitely miss our little boy, but we know that he is in a better place. Some things are not meant to be, no matter what we might otherwise think. We can only take things one step at a time, and to see how we can grow from this episode. It is unfortunate that there had to be so much anguish in our lives, and for those dear to us. I can only hope that we can recover from this. For your sake, I will.
