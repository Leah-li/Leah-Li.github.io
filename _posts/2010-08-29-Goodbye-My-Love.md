沒有人是完美的。何況說 真正有意義的 不是讓自己愛的人接受并通過愛情的考验 而是彼此努力 帶著愛去面對考驗。愛情難道只是一個人的麼？就算能通過了 依靠一個人的勇敢 逞強或者僥倖 也是會讓人傷心的——為著自私的緣故 拋下一個人 獨自去面對一切 自己一邊旁觀。而沒有人完美。

有时情绪因爱而起 但紛繁蕪雜的情绪却无时无刻不在消耗著爱。一如謊言 從真實的土壤里汲取養分 又損傷真實。爲什麽回過頭看 最初愛的人變得不如往昔光彩？是心中漸漸積聚起太多的疲倦與矛盾而不嘗試尋求理解與和解 於是不免相互傷害。再好的愛 再苦心經營也經不住反復無常的折騰。

騰不出時間來交流的人 總得騰出時間來吵架。

喜歡一個人的時候 才會想起 在她的過往時光中 沒能相隨左右 插科打諢 沒能哪怕只默默將視線投注 靜靜瞧著她成長 感受她的喜怒哀樂 是多麼遺憾的事情 錯過難說是過錯 卻無疑憂傷－－她都停留在自己所無法觸及 不能抵達的地方 那麼久長。於是才說 此刻 能有你在身邊 多好。

熱水熱了又涼了 井水還是老樣子。冬天里絲絲暖意 夏天陣陣涼爽 變的是四季和四季的溫度 不變的是井水的狀態 即使是在無法觸及的深深處 一點點彙聚 一點點沉澱掉雜質 變得清亮 。大概 源自深厚大地的東西 才有那樣溫柔而長久的能量。而我想 愛 是不是也應該是這樣。是這樣。

沒被愛過 連拒絕情人節的資格都沒有 就如同沒被關懷著 安心地發脾氣鬧別扭的地方都沒有般可憐？哪個節日是為悲傷而設 哪個人該在獨幕劇中繼續落寞 前一個 我沒聽說過 后一個 不是說誰可以想要什麽就有什麽 但那不意味被冷落 自己依然要自由 心依然可以滿滿的 而等待不會太久。

29 August 2014 changed my life forever. I had ended work early that day after an event and was looking forward to the start of the weekend. J was at the 19th week mark and had a long day at work. She was tired but it didn't seem like much initially. She cab home and was resting after dinner. 

She had mild cramps, which we initially dismiss due to tiredness but the intensity grew stronger. It was worrying, and by around 9+, it didn't seem like it was subsiding and we decided to go to the A&E.  As we waited, I could see J suffering in pain as the attacks grew in intensity. We were concerned and managed to get the doctor to attend to her quickly. The initial diagnosis was that it was likely to be a digestive-related problem and that provided some initial relief. But that was just the calm before the storm.

The rest of the night went by in a blur, yet key moments will always be etched in memory. It was a long arduous night. Anguish engulfed me, but staring into the abyss that you were in, made me grew stronger. We will definitely miss our little boy, but we know that he is in a better place. Some things are not meant to be, no matter what we might otherwise think. We can only take things one step at a time, and to see how we can grow from this episode. It is unfortunate that there had to be so much anguish in our lives, and for those dear to us. I can only hope that we can recover from this. For your sake, I will.
