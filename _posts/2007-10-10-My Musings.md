_All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players._

Like a play, there are two types, tragedies and comedies - and I often view mine as a tragedy. It somehow falls back to the glass being half full or half empty analogy. Like a looking glass, a lens could be all that matters in shaping one's opinion. I have been full of **pessimism** and view the world with a set of negatively tinted lens. This has affected me and more often than not, often results in making worse decision.

Some decisions in life are those that we will live to regret. Yet, there is no way for this flow to reverse its direction and we would just have to accept and live with the decisions we made. There isn't really much we can do once we have made the decision. It is often that we tend to reminisce on how things were and what we should have done instead, like History, a lesson that is often criticized for looking at things once past. It is not that looking back is bad, ideally, we look back to learn from past mistakes but there isn't really a need to dwell too much on it. Any more would just be wallowing in depression.

Despite the many bumps and the occasional pitfalls that we might encounter, life is still very much beautiful. It is hard to sometimes find value in life and I used to have the belief that living is akin to a suffering, a series of trials and tribulations perhaps. I alluded to life being a tragedy at the onset, yet I do have many beautiful and wonderful things that have happened in my life. It is just unfortunate that I tend to let the small unhappy things cloud over the good things and it has been a struggle for me to look at things positively.

The way out of it all? Just relax. We shouldn't think too much and just accept life for the little pleasures that give us, and not brood too much.

Life is indeed a long journey and for all the ups and downs, the final destination for everyone is the same, so enjoy the journey while it lasts.

***Musings 2
It's been awhile since I was out before the sun came out, and wasn't exactly looking forward to it too. Well, don't really have much options to blame other than myself for not getting my bus pass earlier but well, perhaps taking the early cycling trip this morning isn't that bad a thing either.

Looking back, that's just how I am. At times, stingy that I would torture myself etc just to save a dollar?

It was a 10 min trip to Kembangan station, and the moment I turned out from my house, could feel the cold wind coming headlong as I pedalled faster, almost shivering on the bike. Yet, it was surprisingly quite refreshing! I guess I am just very much a morning person and that little morning ride energised me and got me ready for the day. I should do this more often!

Quite strange seeing so many school kids getting ready for school, walking to the MRT or to school, a scene that disappears once the sun comes up. Wasn't it just a few years ago that I was part of this very same school going crowd? Very soon, in a few months time, I will probably be part of this crowd as I will have to get up like at 6, put on my uniform, and make my way to camp. Going backwards in time.

Met Vivien, JC classmate, on the bus to school today and had a chat about how each of us were up to and well, being final year students and all, it wasn't long before we were also talking about Final Year Projects and Graduation Trips. Maybe in comparison, it wasn't such a gleeful discussion as graduation trips on my side look non existent and I am still doing my FYP (zzz). Didn't know Chem Eng. students were so lucky and that their thesis had already been submitted, argh.

I'm indeed looking forward to the end of the semester.

_My Decision to Join the Air Force_

I think 4 years ago, I was undecided what I want to be, and I took up the first job offer that sort of came my way. I'm an Air Engineering Officer. Yet, looking at my friends job hunting now, I think I haven't change all that much in this 4 years and still not sure what I want to do. I guess this dilly-dally over job issues is more to do with my possibly good grades and potential job offers out there, and yet, I am tied down with a SAF LSA scholarship and might be be pegged down based on the various scholarships rankings. A sign of jealousy perhaps? In a materialistic vein, it's all about the money!

In a way, I can see this as a career, it isn't exactly a bad job and it does offer certain levels of prospects and all in all, working with technology is still an interesting thing for me. Furthermore, it could be interesting if I can connect my level of interest and merge it with the aviation stuff. The drawback would be more of how other people view the job? A military job is often looked down upon and unlikely to raise the admirations of people, shucks :) That's my ego speaking.

This has been also a year of rumours, as the AEOs discuss about how our job will be like, the initial phase of training, important gossipy bits such as the pay structure.
