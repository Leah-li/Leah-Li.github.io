_All The World's A Stage, And All The Men And Women Merely Players._

Like a play, there are two types, *tragedies and comedies* - and I often view my life as a tragedy. Perhaps melodramatic but growing up wasn't easy for me. It somehow falls back to the glass being half full or half empty analogy. Like a looking glass, a lens could be all that matters in shaping your opinion. I have been full of **pessimism** and it has resulted in me viewing the world with a set of negatively tinted lens. It's a vivious cycle though. Negative thoughts often lead to poor decisions and equally negative actions, and soon enough, you are caught in this downward spiral. 

Some decisions in life are those that we will live to regret. Yet, there is no way for this flow of time to reverse its direction and we would just have to accept and live with the decisions we made. There isn't really much we can do once we have made the decision. It is often that we tend to reminisce on how things were and what we should have done instead, like History, a lesson that is often criticized for looking at things once past. It is not that looking back is bad, ideally, we look back to learn from past mistakes but there isn't really a need to dwell too much on it. Any more would just be wallowing in depression.

Despite the many bumps and the occasional pitfalls that we might encounter, life is still very much beautiful. It is hard to sometimes find value in life and I used to have the belief that living is akin to a suffering, a series of trials and tribulations perhaps. I alluded to life being a tragedy at the onset, yet I do have many beautiful and wonderful things that have happened in my life. It is just unfortunate that I tend to let the small unhappy things cloud over the good things and it has been a struggle for me to look at things positively.

The way out of it all? I don't know. But for now, my answer is just let it be. There are many things that we can't control, what has happened will always stay in the past, worry less about the future, and live for the present. We shouldn't think too much and just accept life for the little pleasures that give us.

Life is a long journey and for all the ups and downs, the final destination for everyone is the same, so enjoy the ride while it lasts.

_Rise & Shine, Make Hay While The Sun Shines._

It's been awhile since I was out before the sun came out, and I wasn't exactly looking forward to it too. Well, don't really have much options to blame other than myself for not getting my bus pass earlier but well, perhaps taking the early cycling trip this morning isn't that bad a thing either.

Looking back, that's just how I am. At times, stingy that I would torture myself etc just to save a dollar? 

> At the ripe old age of 30, this is still very true though. I would walk 10 more min, in the rain, just to save $1 on a meal, when the food court next to me is charging a bowl of noodles at $4.

It was a 10 min trip to Kembangan station, and the moment I turned out from my house, I could feel the cold wind coming headlong as I pedalled faster, almost shivering on the bike. Yet, it was surprisingly quite refreshing! I guess I am just very much a morning person and that little morning ride energised me and got me ready for the day. 

Quite strange seeing so many school kids getting ready for school, walking to the MRT or to school, a scene that disappears once the sun comes up. Wasn't it just a few years ago that I was part of this very same school going crowd? Very soon, in a few months time, I will probably be part of this crowd as I will have to get up like at 6, put on my uniform, and make my way to camp. Going backwards in time.

> Successful people wake up early.

This topic have been pretty well researched and one common trait across CEOs is that they wake up early. Nope, I am not a CEO and that might be the only common trait I share. The early waking CEOs are described as go-getters who want to start the day before their peers and competitors, who want to work long hours and have enough time for their personal lives too.

The early morning period is when I'm most alert and also most productive. Then everything starts going downhill after that. I like that the start of day is often free of distractions, for me to sort out my thoughts and quickly tackle the crucial tasks first.

_Becoming an Air Engineering Officer_

At the age of 18, I was undecided what I want to be, and I took up the first job offer that sort of came my way. I'm an Air Engineering Officer. Yet, looking at my friends job hunting now, I think I haven't change all that much in this 4 years and still not sure what I want to do. I am tied down with a SAF LSA scholarship and might be pegged down based on the various scholarships rankings. A sign of jealousy perhaps? In a materialistic vein, it's all about the money!

In a way, I can see this as a career, it isn't exactly a bad job and it does offer certain levels of prospects and all in all, working with technology is still an interesting thing for me. Furthermore, it could be interesting if I can connect my level of interest and merge it with the aviation stuff. One drawback though would be more of how other people view the job? In Singapore, it seems like a military job is often looked down upon and unlikely to raise the admirations of people, shucks :) That's my ego speaking.

Not sure if I miss anything out, oh well, a just in case, at least I can possibly try make the tarts myself in years to come haha, although that's like just a potential HUGE disaster waiting to happen.

and Jiali gets 1 tub + the BIG one!
Its only 1 more day to CNY, not really very festive this time around, its always been one of the major calendar events in my life but this year everything seems less exciting. Anyway, I was eating pineapple tarts this morning, argh! I left 3 only haha... gosh. But then again, another tub will be open tomorrow morning so there's still some cheer there. Homemade pineapple tarts are just very unique and special, I have grown so fond of them!
... The 4th Pineapple Tart last seen here ...

For the past Chinese New Years, I would get up by 7+ am, greet my grandfather, grandmother, dad.. followed by the customary red packets. As we are officially not celebrating this year, the occasion and all seems somewhat strange and muted.

Looking back at the past, when I was much younger, always looked forward to the nintendos / playstations that my cousin would bring over to play. I didn't had my own console and could only play when I go over to their house, so this was like a real treat for me. Sometimes they would also leave the system at my place for a couple of days so the 2nd/3rd day of Chinese New Year was also very much a blast! I know I would be eagerly anticipating the arrival of my cousins and the one year they forgot to bring, I was so sad!

And how can I leave out gambling? We usually only gamble with the closer relatives, the visitors who come don't really join in either. Strangely, our gambling is like "见不得人" and during the normal years, we will keep the gambling confine to my room, so that kind of keeps people out, and not to mention the games we play. We play quite a lot of "gin rummy", "in between" and recently, "dai dee". We only played blackjack once, and didn't really like it, so that was just a one year event. I guess, games like gin rummy and dai dee are still very much games where although luck plays a part, your destiny is still within your control. So gaming vs gambling, always such a torn every year, and I'm always being pulled towards the gambling side zzz.

Safety in numbers. I guess that's how I feel every year too, since I'm close to my direct cousins, hardly venture out of this safety net to engage the other cousins and will not talk to them much. I guess this would have to change! This year, a group of the "not so close" cousins were early, so had to talk to them since the rest wasn't here. Ok, Samuel and Deborah, my two cousins! At least now I know two names, haha. This also brings to mind another thing I should do, family tree, especially with a big one like mine.

The food! We usually will receive quite a bit of bak kwa from friends and relatives so always had some to munch on over the festive season but they were mainly my grandfather friends, so didn't get any this year. That's still snacks though, the real food is when dinner arrives. Curry, Ayam Buah Keluak, Ngoh Hiang, Kiam Chye Ah (Salted Veg Duck Soup), Roasted Duck, Leftover soup from steamboat, and all the strange CNY vegetables. So many food to eat! Strangely, there's really alot of food to eat, and alot of them are those that I like, yet, perhaps its tiredness or perhaps full from the snacks, I don't recall having a big feast or tremendously enjoying the CNY dinner. Hmm....
