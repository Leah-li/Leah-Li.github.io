"We're goin to the zoo, zoo, zoo
How about you, you, you?
You can come too, too, too
Were goin to the zoo, zoo, zoo… "

Happy song for a happy day, end of this "doesn't feel like term break" term break marks a special visit to the zoo. Having not gone there since like primary school, couldn't really remember how the zoo once was and it was very much a fresh new experience, albeit limited as well, zoos are still zoos :) How different can they get!

At the entrance.. Parrots! I think I remembered correctly though it might be a bit weird, but seems like quite a number of Singapore Attractions are fronted by parrots at the entrance, namely the Zoo, Bird Park (duh), Sentosa. I don't recall such a scenario in overseas Zoos or places, hmm. Trying to show off the tropical aspect of Singapore? Anyway, they are pretty pretty birds, these bunch were quite quiet though, despite the efforts of a number of kids coaxing them to say the usual "Hello!".

It was feeding time and as the monkeys got food from the keeper, it seems to feed some to the fishes below and what appeared to be stroking them! I don't think monkeys actually eat fishes now, do they?
