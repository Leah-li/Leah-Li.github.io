Star Wars was my favourite movie growing up. It still is. A mystical force, telekinetic capabilities and duels with lightsabers were really attractive to me as a young boy. I grew up on hand me down Star Wars figures from my cousins, and I was around 12-13 when the Phantom Menace was released. Despite it being such a poor story, I still watched it twice. Alongside the fledging Star Wars community in Singapore, I started my own toy collection around the same time too.

It was exciting times. Hasbro would release the Star Wars figures in waves, and each wave would have a few popular characters and unknowns. However, getting those popular characters often proved difficult. Phantom Menace saw the introduction of one of the coolest villians, the acrobatic Darth Maul and as an action figure, it was equally hard to catch hold of him. Many trips to Toys R Us and big departmental stores often yielded unfavourable results and the next options were to buy the action figures from scalpers, collectible shops etc. That was my first exposure to the Clarke Quay flea market and also shops such as The Falcon's Hanger (TFH).

At that early age, there's a lot more opportunity for trying out new interests and activities. It just so happened that my interest was in collecting action figures. It was a way for me to meet like minded folks in the Star Wars community, and for me to immerse myself in. Thinking back, the whole star wars saga did had a large impact on me when I was young, it was a movie, a universe that was so well developed that I could delve into it and create my own fantasy - through dioramas. The first picture shows a printed Jawa Sandcrawler - via papercraft. It was a great sense of achievement as you put the whole vehicle together. Btw, I was 14-15 at that time :).

It also granted some father / son bonding time. As my collection grew, I pestered my dad for a display cabinet and we spend some time hunting around for one. The fun was in putting it together. The shelf is still around, even after 18 years. Even though we installed one shelf in the opposite direction, I still look at it and smile fondly as I remember how we work together. Life is never perfect, it is filled with tons of imperfections and challenges, yet each mistake we make is for a purpose, and would only make us wiser and stronger.
