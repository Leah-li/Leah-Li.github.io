A Phuket getaway straight after exams, to mark the start of our holidays. The 4 of us, minus Gabriel once again, on our 2nd trip together. Having erm, done KL and Genting, we ventured abit further to Phuket, Thailand this time!

Well, our airfares, wah, we manage to get our 1 dollar Tiger Airways tickets, but with taxes and all, it added up to 120 dollars, accommodation was around 67, and well, overall expenditure.. of food, shopping and entertainment a total of 350 dollars, wee, cheap for 4D3N!

Anyway, checking in to our hotel, wa, a bit of a letdown as everything felt abit old and grimey, erm.. no Aircon at the reception area, or the corridors and when we went to the room, dishes were left near the lift, seemed rather dirty. I guess, for a supposed 4 star hotel, we were expecting abit more, but we did take the standard (much cheaper) rooms as opposed to the deluxe which was more highly recommended. Still, its good enough for dai dee!

Next morning, went to had breakfast, or rather, we were the breakfast for the mosquitoes. Our breakfast for the next 3 days, well, a decent enough spread, food quality wasn't the best, but we were able to fill our stomachs for the next 3 days. International and local dishes! Anyway, the problem was the mosquitoes! So many blood suckers around, and a friendly Mynah that wasn't people shy, and would stick around searching for leftovers.

Went touring round the Hotel, plus checked out the swimming pool, which was quite nice, had a lot of interesting decorations, jacuzzi areas, etc etc... and poolside bar, and well, guess that's what gives it its 4 star name. We lazed and swam around till around 10+ before heading to the beach. The skies were getting cloudy and wanted to at least check out the beach before the rain comes.

Patong beach, definitely the most commercialised and crowded beach in all of Phuket. I don't think I would reccomend here for beach activities as it is way too populated with people and sales touts advertising their water sports activities. It gets quite irritating after awhile and if you are seeking peace and tranquility, here's definitely not the place. However, in terms of shopping, night life and just overall buzz, here's the place to be.

Anyway, since we are here already, we decided to try out the jet ski and it was crazily fun. It's definitely a great way to explore the island, although you are told not to go too far, I guess some liberties can be taken. Although one of my friend did ran out of fuel so its not that good an idea to be too far away when it happens. Its fast and can feel the wind, water, salt in your face as you travel faster and faster, with the jet ski bouncing and you start to lose control... thrilling!

The night life seems more toned down from what was previously publicized but there are still number of pubs, girls etc all around, and erm.. lady boys? We were looking for our next day Phi Phi island tour and after much enquires with the many tour agents spread across the town, we finally found our desired ship and at the cheapest rate of 750 baht!

It was a fight night and the boxers were in open roof vans passing flyers around trying to get people to watch, it was crazy, 45 dollars for the match, that's money I wasn't interested in parting, and I think to celebrate the fight, fireworks were set off, guess it was a pretty big fight actually. And just two days before, I was so hyped up to watch the Oscar De La Hoya vs Floyd Mayweather Jr fight, billed as the biggest boxing event this year! Mayweather won incidentally, erm, sort of like a story book fight.

Off to Phi Phi island, the minivan pickup was at 0700 so we had to wake up early, get breakfast etc and then wait for the bus. It took us about an hour to reach the ferry terminal which was located on the other side of the island and wah, the skies were great today, clear, blue, white wispy clouds.. ahh.. perfect!

So many various agencies at the terminal, I guess all of them are about the same, traveling the same route, in a way, ours is good as it wasn't so crowded as some of the other boats so it gave us alot of space to laze and horse around on the top deck! No chairs though, but hey just lying down and feeling the sea wind is good enough.

The view was great, and managed to get lots of nice postcard - esque shots, shall remember to include more people in them next time!

The water was really very clear and when we finally stopped to do some snorkeling, there were lots of small fishes and they kept flocking to the bread that the people on board will throw at them. To be honest, didn't really enjoyed the snorkeling, felt it was quite boring, and didn't had much to swim. And the equipment they provided was a turn off, first erm, wonder about the cleanliness of the mouthpiece and the goggles had a funny smell! Ahh.. after that, went to some island for lunch, had a very nice beach there! Clear sand, clear water, beautiful backdrop!
