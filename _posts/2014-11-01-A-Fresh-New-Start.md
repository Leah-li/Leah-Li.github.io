#My Journey to Github

* Wordpress History
* Shifting to Jekyll
* Learning Kramdown / Markdown
* What's Next

I wouldn't call myself a developer, nor a web designer, but I enjoy doing such activities. I have been dabbling with computers, web page designing, wordpress, php / mysql, django and the likes. This is my first journey to Git and also the use of Markdown / Kramdown syntax.

Learning new things can be painful too. But rewarding.
