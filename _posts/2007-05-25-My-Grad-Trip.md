Taiwan Grad Trip! An event to mark the end of 4 years of my education and to symbolise the friendship that has been forged during them. Not all were able to join us for our graduation trip and off goes the 3 of us as we embarked on our trip together, Linghuey, Andy and me!

## Day 1

There was to be no luxury of service, drinks, or movies on board the 5 hour budget flight, and had to survive on a solitary can of Pepsi which was gulped down shortly after it landed on the mini foldable table. That cost me $3! Well at least there were quite a number of us, the ME group, Sheerine, + us = 10, to entertain ourselves. Liwei had a nifty thing with cards but the real fun started when Andy took out his PSP, and choice of game was some word hunt thing, similar to the Yahoo! games. He was just too good though. Can't beat the speed at which he is able to spot and link up the words, hack. CHEAT.

At CKS Airport, our first stop was to get the Youth Pass, which we didn't use at all! Haha, guess we still do very much look like students after all so didn't had to show it, not like there were many opportunities, hmm. It was then a 1 hr ride to the city on the Guo Guang bus. First glimpse of the sheer number of bikes in the city and their many face masks. We had to collect our train tickets that had previously been booked in Singapore and along the way grabbed some bread as we were already starving by this time. It was some extra large green tea bun along with a standard pork floss bun, done 'breadtalk' style. Yummy?

What followed was our first attempt at navigating the streets of Taipei and it was a failure! Luckily though, through it, we had a brief glimpse of the Taipei Underground Mall which we will not be revisiting.

Our hotel, Keyman Hotel was quite near the Train Station, really a quaint little hotel, very much non-descript but the room was ok, clean and bright. We managed to get through to Ivan, Andy and LH's friend, luckily! He was more familiar with Taipei and our unofficial 'tour guide' of the night. Oh at the train station we also purchased the EasyCard which is the equivalent of our Ezlink and we started "t-teeing" our way to Jiantan MRT for our first travel stop.

Shihlin Night Market. Ahh, just lots and lots of food, alot of must try, and with it being our first night and all, was probably the one where we ate the most! Shihlin's a huge place and after satisfying our initial craving of food, we did spend most of the night weaving in and out through the stores although we weren't interested to shop all that much considering our long journey ahead. Think this is probably one of the more interesting night markets, with a mixture of both food and shopping. We stayed there till around 11pm and although we did attempt to cover the entire area, didn't really succeeded with some of the portions left unexplored.

## Day 2

We will look back upon and think of this day, the day that will be forever etched in our memories, the day 2 of our trip, the one that made it great.

Having to wake up at 6+ to check out and catch our early train to Hualien, we were all very much zombified still and breakfast was settled at 7-Eleven (our first of many stops), before we went to grab the train, which was rather comfy and though we didn't look out much, there was quite a nice view outside. We managed to contact our tour guide who was very friendly and he picked us up at the train station for our Taroko Gorge Day Tour. He's like a mini celebrity on the TripAdvisor / Hardwarezone forums with many people raving about his services and all that was said was indeed true! But before that, a dabao lunch stop first "清淡又好吃". Well its good advice cos the food / COFFEE price up at the gorge was really not economical.

And off we go up the mountain! Hmm, sat in front, which meant, with a talkative Tour Guide, I had to keep replying him all the way! AH. Whole Day / Night! But haha, it was quite fun anyway,but my chinese cannot make it, so it was hard to both understand and be understood.

<img src="http://lh6.google.com/image/kaer84/RlOhvn_gTEI/AAAAAAAABb4/GK8X9dD2E9k/s288/DSCF1976.JPG" />
... at the entrance ...

Our first tour stop was the 砂卡礑 trail, where we had to walk in for 20 min, could see the valley and the water formation underneath. It was quite beautiful and the fun started when we climbed down towards the rocky area.

<img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/kaer84/RlOl_3_gTmI/AAAAAAAABgI/KMbD7VA9dD4/s288/DSCF2013.JPG" />
<img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/kaer84/RlOnK3_gTwI/AAAAAAAABhY/lPaiudULt8c/s288/DSCF2023.JPG" />
.. big rock (one of the smaller ones still) ...

Other than some oppurtune photo moments along the way, the next place should be the Swallow Grotto or 燕子口.

<img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/kaer84/RlOpUH_gUGI/AAAAAAAABkI/Cp8ZngJHl8c/s288/DSCF2049.JPG" />

Alot of places for one to stop and look for the swallows, but they fly so fast, anyway, they aren't really very pretty haha.

<img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/kaer84/RlOqCH_gUNI/AAAAAAAABlA/TKDVPEJSiUU/s288/DSCF2057.JPG" />
...swallow in flight...

<img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/kaer84/RlOqgH_gUTI/AAAAAAAABlw/UNDeIKsYts4/s288/DSCF2067.JPG" />
...the view from on top...

<img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/kaer84/RlOr1H_gUgI/AAAAAAAABnY/xxSFcnU0lqA/s288/DSCF2080.JPG" />

<img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/kaer84/RlOtH3_gUpI/AAAAAAAABog/1efzIsE0yYY/s288/DSCF2089.JPG" />
... there's a red indian (stone) in the background ...

Oh well, after that we made a stop. Mr Taxi Guide asked us whether any of us drink coffee and said the coffee here was their own brew or something, ahh, the stupid normal iced coffee cost us S$7.50. It did tasted a bit different, but ahem, expensive! Haha.. well, tourists are always meant to be chopped. We then had our lunch, which was the bento, soup with funny looking meatballs, and yakult!

<img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/kaer84/RlOtc3_gUsI/AAAAAAAABo4/UdXQyj15qHk/s288/DSCF2092.JPG" />
... lunching in the great outdoors ...

<img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/kaer84/RlOv5H_gVDI/AAAAAAAABrw/qUrmwv0a9tY/s288/DSCF2116.JPG" />
... next stop after lunch ...

<img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/kaer84/RlOvd3_gU_I/AAAAAAAABrQ/jZPdxh6NTAo/s288/DSCF2112.JPG" />

Its suppose to be some 9 turn tunnel cave, where in times of darkness, goofiness reigns. And no, the entire 9 turn isn't like such, there's alot of breaks in between for you to look up and admire and realise just how bloody big the whole place is!

<img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/kaer84/RlOug3_gU1I/AAAAAAAABqA/VnthFczg_Ys/s144/DSCF2102.JPG" />
<img src="http://lh6.google.com/image/kaer84/RlOukn_gU2I/AAAAAAAABqI/JncnZLSBZe4/s144/DSCF2103.JPG" />

One of the attractions there was this rock formation. Its some fish jumping over the gates of hell / heaven to retrieve eggs or something. Haha. Gosh, the story they tell sometimes. But yup, initially I couldn't recognise how it was a fish, but it gets easier after staring at it for awhile. Guess that goes with most of things in life!

<img src="http://lh5.google.com/image/kaer84/RlOxfX_gVPI/AAAAAAAABtQ/nmeklD_Eg3Y/s288/DSCF2129.JPG" />
Yes.. more weird things to spot!

<img src="http://lh6.google.com/image/kaer84/RlOyQn_gVXI/AAAAAAAABuQ/OwMPzcwM1kI/s288/DSCF2139.JPG" />
... king kong in the background ...

Oh there's a weird Planetary Museum somewhere along the way, its free anyway, and we stopped there for our toilet break, ermm.. well, just not something you would expect to find in the middle of like a mountain reserve haha. Imagine the person working there so sad, although slack, no transport, and so very very boring. Boring-ness in work is really a bad thing, I can vouch for it!

<img src="http://lh5.google.com/image/kaer84/RlOy4X_gVfI/AAAAAAAABvQ/tZg3Iu91tCc/s288/DSCF2149.JPG" />
... temple here too! ...

And finally, we arrive to the highlight of Taroko! The cave. Pitch Black. Cold. Damp. Equipped with raincoats and umbrellas. We started to move towards an unknown destination with only the trust of our Tour Guide.

<img src="http://lh6.google.com/image/kaer84/RlOzDn_gVhI/AAAAAAAABvg/r3xDUPesa8I/s288/DSCF2151.JPG" />
... us scared ...

This was really just a teaser for later, but having emerged from the dark tunnel, well, more rest and pictures ensued, as what followed was a long walk to the next point, which wasn't all that bad actually as we get to have a closer look at the mountains from here.

<img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/kaer84/RlOzl3_gVvI/AAAAAAAABxQ/Xf0uow4rxaA/s288/DSCF2177.JPG" />

The next point was quite nice. As we walked closer and closer, the gushing noise of water grew louder and so did our anticipation as well, but it was still quite beautiful. Its erm, a vertically challenged waterfall! A suspension bridge connected it to another area where we could see more waterfalls in the background, but those were rather far away, and anywhere with a suspension bridge always adds some fun!

<img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/kaer84/RlO2P3_gWKI/AAAAAAAAB0o/vyl4z0taq5s/s288/DSCF2206.JPG" />

<img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/kaer84/RlO2qH_gWNI/AAAAAAAAB1A/OIE2RIFjRG4/s288/DSCF2209.JPG" />

There was another tunnel and this time, there really was not a single light source as it was twisting inside also, so we were not able to see the light coming from the exit until we were nearer. Wah, haha, there wasn't a difference between opening and closing your eyes and really had to trust the person in front as well as the railing to hold. It was really quite fun! And then... finally we arrive at the 水濂洞 or Water Curtain Cave.

<img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/kaer84/RlO343_gWXI/AAAAAAAAB2Q/yA7qIFigA_A/s288/DSCF2219.JPG" />

It was a wet wet wet place. The water level was around calf height and we finally get to don our raincoats. Shoes off, pants rolled up, raincoats on, which also means dangerous place for cameras. Ahh...

<img src="http://lh5.google.com/image/kaer84/RlO4NX_gWZI/AAAAAAAADJM/a27Muq1qKP4/s288/DSCF2221.JPG" />
... in preparation ...

<img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/kaer84/RlO4y3_gWfI/AAAAAAAAB3Q/DhHqaD5UIDs/s288/DSCF2227.JPG" />

<img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/kaer84/RlO5x3_gWoI/AAAAAAAAB4Y/ke4Am3n0_gQ/s288/DSCF2236.JPG" />
... pitch black actually ...

We really couldnt see much when inside the cave, but the water kept falling from the top and there was really alot, and very cold water too! We made friends with a Taiwan couple there who was also at the cave same time as us, they didn't know that it was possible to go in and well, comparatively more ill-equipped as opposed to us. They were very nice people and they gave us alot of suggestions on things to do later on at both Kaohsiung and Taipei.

<img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/kaer84/RlO5R3_gWkI/AAAAAAAAB34/yn4VU9vnwIc/s288/DSCF2232.JPG" />

We had plans to play with fireworks later on at night and our tour guide graciously invited them along also, so the 5 of us continued on for the rest of the trip. The return trip down Taroko was definitely not as exciting having just completed the highlight so we only stopped a couple of places, the 岳飞亭 and somewhere else with a place unknown, before we made a departure.

<img src="http://lh5.google.com/image/kaer84/RlO7-X_gW_I/AAAAAAAAB7Q/aR-S-D68Cqs/s144/DSCF2259.JPG" />

It was getting dark and wanted to see the sunset I think at 七星潭, but it was too dark by the time we reached so we couldn't really see much here. Its just a very normal beach, although one that is next to a cemetery, makes it a tad weird and discomforting.

<img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/kaer84/RlO8-3_gXLI/AAAAAAAAB8w/g_L1BgP-puw/s288/DSCF2276.JPG" />

<img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/kaer84/RlO9d3_gXWI/AAAAAAAAB-I/1Qh6nIZqEfY/s288/DSCF2289.JPG" />

Ahh.. Finally dinner, which was some wanton thingy, no noodles, just wanton, erm, I didn't really liked it, but its supposed to be quite famous in Hualien so oh well, haha, which was actually quite filling so wasn't too bad.

<img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/kaer84/RlO953_gXbI/AAAAAAAAB-w/vWYBkko8Pyk/s288/DSCF2296.JPG" />
<img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/kaer84/RlO-w3_gXmI/AAAAAAAACAI/0fECjsJVlbk/s288/DSCF2307.JPG" />

... our ubiquitous 泡泡茶 stop ...

Our taiwan friend bought for us some weird cereal oat thingy, which also had pearls inside, or didn't, ermm quite weird ah, like drinking oatmeal, very filling and thick! Our taxi driver then picked us up again after dinner and off we went to 鲤鱼潭. Once again, cannot see anything at night, but that was not what we were here for and the main purpose is to play with fireworks! Our taxi driver had kindly sponsored us some to play and he had drove all the way home earlier while we were having dinner to take them.

<img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/kaer84/RlO_5H_gX2I/AAAAAAAACCI/ZYM0PT5ieyQ/s288/DSCF2325.JPG" />
... nice arc ...

Fun!!! Never had the chance to play with fireworks before and this was quite exciting. Scary, ahem, no thanks to Andy who couldn't plant the stick properly leaving it stuck in the ground. Ended up, it stayed there and exploded! LH and me were left staring at it in shock and ears still ringing as we were closest to the blast. Haha, but it was still fun nonetheless!

With that, we moved off to another area where there were fireflies! One more not available in Singapore moment!

<img src="http://lh5.google.com/image/kaer84/RlPRVX_gX7I/AAAAAAAACCs/cJXCWHO3Is4/s288/DSCF2329.JPG" />
... view on the other side of the pond ...

<img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/kaer84/RlPRiH_gYCI/AAAAAAAACDk/T_A8iNKtNjw/s288/DSCF2338.JPG" />
... the firefly catching squad ...

Haha, quite cute! Didn't know fireflies keep switching on / off their lights and there were quite a number of them, managed to catch a couple too but they are equally good at escaping as well, haha. Firefly actually looks like a giant ant, hmm, abit more friendly looking though, make up your own imagination! If you wanna see, then go catch your own!

Last stop. Ali Ba Ba 民宿. We had booked this room based on the pictures we saw and seriously, for one of the rare times, the pictures did no justice with the rooms looking better in real life! The owner's mum offered us a quad room as we had 3 people but we had initially booked for the normal double room which was 500-700 NT cheaper, and so we asked if we could stick to our original plan of the double room. She said she would check for us but wah, when she came back, it was with her son (the owner) who wasn't in too good a mood. He was FURIOUS. Haha.. somehow, the message that got across was that we wanted the quad room at the double room rate, and he was extremely crappy, haha, said he was worried that we could be some criminals, murderers and the like, and was about to chase us out, then since we are students, etc, then ok. Haha, his mum was like constantly hitting him lightly, asking him to tone down etc. Anyway, after that unpleasant moment, the mum came back and offered us the room at 1300NT, cheap! We were more than happy to pay 1500NT for it already, but hey, more discounts = good!

<img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/kaer84/RlPRq3_gYGI/AAAAAAAACEE/5EZdS5lS75s/s288/DSCF2342.JPG" />

We had full access to the house and this was the downstairs which was well equipped, and that's us after shower and off to find our supper!

<img src="http://lh6.google.com/image/kaer84/RlPSVn_gYWI/AAAAAAAACGE/CZJV47M4Vvw/s288/DSCF2359.JPG" /> 

<img src="http://lh6.google.com/image/kaer84/RlPSin_gYaI/AAAAAAAACGk/cJYchLq_0QY/s288/DSCF2365.JPG" />

There wasn't much food left by that timing, so we trooped off to 7-Eleven and Andy and I being less adventurous, stuck to classics like cup noodles, which wasn't cheap, around 2 dollars, but it had meat, and large chunks, not the crappy dehydrated sort. LH was definitely more brave, she tried some food on a stick, abit like yong tau foo.

<img src="http://lh6.google.com/image/kaer84/RlPSmn_gYcI/AAAAAAAACG0/6_zuEVgMMWk/s288/DSCF2369.JPG" />

Taroko had so many things to see, its all just so serene and beautiful that many of the pictures here, each can tell its own story. Then the multiple experiences at night, many of them being the first time, also made for good fun. Well, and to conclude it, we all had a nice room to get much needed rest!

## Day 3

Another waking up early day, gosh, the trip starting to take its toll as we have another early train to catch, this time a draining 5 hr ride to Kaohsiung. We dumped out stuff at the main house or erm lobby, where we found the Ali BaBa mascot, the one that made us chose this location, and we eagerly snapped pictures with it! Haha, guess the entire decor of the place is not only aesthetically pleasing but with the numerous soft toys around, makes for quite a homely feel. We went around looking for breakfast and stumbled on this roadside stall that sells erm, 饭团. Its just meat wrapped in rice, with quite a number of other weird ingredients, not too bad I guess.

<img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/kaer84/RlPTN3_gYmI/AAAAAAAACIE/u8GqVIz2TYk/s144/DSCF2380.JPG" />

<img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/kaer84/RlPTgH_gYrI/AAAAAAAACIw/Qs4ru3e4_yU/s144/DSCF2385.JPG" />  

Onboard the 5 hr train ride, LH was immediately in la la land and dunno y, Andy and me hardly slept the journey. Lucky got PSP to keep us entertained! The stupid tennis game, ahhh. Nightmares. Haha, after we finally beat some nameless person in Round 3, had to go against Andy Roddick, cannot win! Oh well. We did stop at some of the train stations to take photos, ahem, so I've been to Taitung! Lunch was also bought earlier at 7-Eleven once again, AHH. No wonder we got quite sick of it later lol, but the train do sell food and though we didn't buy, the prices didn't seem all that expensive.

<img src="http://lh6.google.com/image/kaer84/RlPUGn_gY4I/AAAAAAAACKY/ppL7t2GkrSw/s288/DSCF2402.JPG" />

The previous night before, we were kept entertained by this Taiwan talk show, done mostly in Hokkien and perhaps the novelty of the language kept us hooked. It got us in stitches with 2 phrases! "没拜拜就没保庇", "吃人够够". Which was so applicable to our Kaohsiung segment, as we got exploited as tourists and with so many things not going our way, sigh.

Oh well. When we finally arrive in Kaohsiung, we had to look for our Hotel and upon finally pinpointing the location, we realised it was on the other side of Kaohsiung. Kinda like the city vs the slums, and we were on the slummy side of town, with a nice railway line separating the two, with the way there being not very accessible, had to go through some construction area. So sad! The entire city looked very sad, yellowish-grey skies, smog-ridden, had a stench of despair to it and it quickly infected us as well, but well, still smiling in the pictures below as we made our way across the track.

<img src="http://lh5.google.com/image/kaer84/RlPVCX_gZKI/AAAAAAAACMo/XpmxrcfyXM4/s144/DSCF2425.JPG" />

<img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/kaer84/RlPVO3_gZMI/AAAAAAAACM4/CHE4HwvAMo0/s144/DSCF2427.JPG" />  

As we had booked a double room once again, this time, we decided to be more secretive and Andy / LH went to check in first while I loitered outside, but it was one of the better things in KS actually, as the room given was actually a 2 queen/king sized bed so we had ample space! Anyway, while waiting downstairs, I went walking round the Hotel area, but it was so ulu! All the shops were closed and very little people around, really felt like a deserted side of town.

After they came down, we started on our travelling and first qns already kenna banged. When we looked at the tourist map, they had already drawn in the MRT stops so we thought we could move around via that, however upon enquiries, it wasn't scheduled to be open until end 2007. Oh well. As we had to crossed back to the city side, this time we took a more populated route, the railway bridge cross over but wah, they actually charged a ticket, 月台票 just to cross the platform! It's only 6 NT ~ 30 cents, but the audacity of it all! Just a stupid flyover, and not like its airconditioned or have escalators or what not, ahh, walking also need to pay toll charges, stupid!

Well, with that idiocy out of the way, we took a bus to the Gushan Ferry Terminal for a 10NT ferry to Qi Jing, where we saw this shop called dua wa gong (大碗公) haha, very big! They have another size bowl (even bigger) displayed outside but think that one really not meant for consumption, can feed 10 people lo.. but they did put 世界杯3000CC, so well, erm, go there and try again?

<img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/kaer84/RlPV-3_gZXI/AAAAAAAACOQ/mtAVVN2zQEw/s288/DSCF2438.JPG" />

Somehow ferry rides aren't all that bad, there's the seaview, breeze, feeling of being on deck that makes it all quite fun, its just a short ferry ride though, something like the old harbourfront to sentosa distance!

First stop at Qi Jing was the 天后宫 temple and just said a little prayer before moving on. Haha, should have prayed more though! We then walked around the beach, towards the harbour, lighthouse area and just kinda took our time exploring there. The pier design was quite unique though, with a long platform stretching out, and ships had to pass through sort of a gate to enter the docking areas. There was a star gazing tunnel, and if you clap your hands, the birds will chirp, which was really quite dumb, since it erm, doesn't fit in with the astro - theme at all?

The beach was unique in the sense that the sand was black? No idea why though.. probably just the mineral content, but unique as it is, the colour wasn't all that enticing for us to go play with as well, it resembled dirt! Who can blame us!

And well, dinner time. Being at the beach, it is apt to have seafood! So of we went searching for a suitable restaurant. Haha, bad bad experience. Perhaps we were enticed by the supposedly cheap prices but its actually based on per person and well, overall it ain't cheap! Guess the 3 of us weren't much of weird seafood eaters, so perhaps this wasn't such a good idea after all!

We ordered 5 dishes (from top in clockwise manner):

1) Sotong Ball! (Not shown in picture, this is one of the best actually)
2) Squid like tentacle - deep fried
3) Shark skin (Super chewy, gah, like rubber)
4) Clam shell like thing
5) Weird hard crunchy thing, black in colour

haha, so many unknown weird descriptions and aiya, with stuff like this, how to stomach it down, and the cook was bad, dishes weren't nice and the stuff were just erm, weird and bad. The shellfish had sand inside also, damn bad la...

the remains

not much difference lo, haha... food here really cannot make it, give me a night market anytime! We left the place as well as Qi Jing feeling displeased and cheated, haha cos it turned out to be quite expensive also, think around $15 plus per person and not high end seafood also. (SOTONG BALL LO!)

Back in Kaohsiung, we headed for the Love River and started an intensive session of photo whoring that finally stopped when we ended up at the Harujuku square street market (name also must copy!) + show off my camera abit!

... another perspective ...

It was quite nice just walking down the river and looking at the sights, sadly didn't had a chance to go the Taipei Lover's Bridge which was suppose to be nicer at night with the lights but this wasn't a disappointment and turned out much better that the stories we have heard of it, haha, like the stench which other than a small segment, didn't carry over to the rest of the river.

Next stop, 城市光廊 or Urban Spotlight. Not sure what it is exactly but seems more like a chillout place with a live singer and lights in an urban park?

Other than an eggtart, doughnut, shopping, stationery break in between, we ended up at the LiouHe Night Market! Well, food's always good, we tried quite a nice variety once again, fried ice cream! oyster omelette (we requested without oyster after our seafood scare, erm abit bo hua hor), dumplings, etc etc.. There was also a near fatal accident as I poked Andy with the satay stick ACCIDENTALLY. Ok, I need training on how to feed a person haha.

With that, tired, we took our tired bodies back to the Hotel, but were still rejuvenated enough to play dice! Loser drinks a full glass of water, or subject to a whack with the cane that we bought. Luckily, I was not the one who had to keep waking up to go to the toilet, whew!
