when one door closes.. another opens...

we are often so preoccupied with the loss of some opportunities that we tend to miss the new opportunities present to us. I have been lucky at my career. It has not been the smoothest of paths but I am happy with what chances and opportunities it has given me thus far. Its going to be a challenging year ahead.. and that just means it is time to work harder!

Anyway, I am seriously getting fatter. Weighing in at about 65 kg now, and it is definitely not muscle mass gained. UNFORTUNATELY. Haha...

I am once again spurred by sudden motivation to start exercising and whipping my body back into shape. This feeling has came and gone for quite a few times in my life and I have to admit that each moment of burst has at least forced me to keep in relatively decent shape which is still a good thing. Yet, consistency is the key if I want to achieve my dream of a fit, muscular body, but I have all too often let myself lose to the laziness. 

J describes it as a typical roller coaster ride. You go up and down. And that's true. When struggling to survive, us humans will do everything it takes to pull through. Yet, once they reach a pace of survival, things slow down, they start becoming complacent, and down you go again. The cycle keeps repeating. 

Well, how long will this new found momentum be able to carry itself? I doubt it will last more than a week or two to be honest, what with work getting in the way and all. I can't blame it on anything other than myself considering that there's a gym in the office but I hardly use it, more keen to head home instead of spending precious time there. Perhaps its a mentality that I should be changing. Let's see how the next few weeks take me.

I have also started on new interest activities. Instead of just keeping it to the gym and weights, I am also now exploring, running. It's part of technology in action, with my geeky setup for jogging.

> Bluetooth earphones linked up with a GPS phone that measures the distance + calories burnt of my run :) 

Everything connects easily and it just works (though some might say the initial setup is a PITA). Actually, knowing how far you run and how fast you run is a great motivator. But, the challenge of carrying a phone with you while running is a genuine problem and even if you can, there is also a problem of water ingression, which can drive many gadgets conker. The particular pair of bluetooth earphones died after a few vigourous runs after exposure to sweat. Phone survived though, I ran most times with an armband strap. Do note that the cheaper ones are not waterproof and can be stained with your sweat.

沒有人是完美的。何況說 真正有意義的 不是讓自己愛的人接受并通過愛情的考验 而是彼此努力 帶著愛去面對考驗。愛情難道只是一個人的麼？就算能通過了 依靠一個人的勇敢 逞強或者僥倖 也是會讓人傷心的——為著自私的緣故 拋下一個人 獨自去面對一切 自己一邊旁觀。而沒有人完美。

有时情绪因爱而起 但紛繁蕪雜的情绪却无时无刻不在消耗著爱。一如謊言 從真實的土壤里汲取養分 又損傷真實。爲什麽回過頭看 最初愛的人變得不如往昔光彩？是心中漸漸積聚起太多的疲倦與矛盾而不嘗試尋求理解與和解 於是不免相互傷害。再好的愛 再苦心經營也經不住反復無常的折騰。

喜歡一個人的時候 才會想起 在她的過往時光中 沒能相隨左右 插科打諢 沒能哪怕只默默將視線投注 靜靜瞧著她成長 感受她的喜怒哀樂 是多麼遺憾的事情 錯過難說是過錯 卻無疑憂傷－－她都停留在自己所無法觸及 不能抵達的地方 那麼久長。於是才說 此刻 能有你在身邊 多好。

熱水熱了又涼了 井水還是老樣子。冬天里絲絲暖意 夏天陣陣涼爽 變的是四季和四季的溫度 不變的是井水的狀態 即使是在無法觸及的深深處 一點點彙聚 一點點沉澱掉雜質 變得清亮 。大概 源自深厚大地的東西 才有那樣溫柔而長久的能量。而我想 愛 是不是也應該是這樣。是這樣。

沒被愛過 連拒絕情人節的資格都沒有 就如同沒被關懷著 安心地發脾氣鬧別扭的地方都沒有般可憐？哪個節日是為悲傷而設 哪個人該在獨幕劇中繼續落寞 前一個 我沒聽說過 后一個 不是說誰可以想要什麽就有什麽 但那不意味被冷落 自己依然要自由 心依然可以滿滿的 而等待不會太久。
