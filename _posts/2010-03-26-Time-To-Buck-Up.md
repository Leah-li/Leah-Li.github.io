when one door closes.. another opens...
we are often so preoccupied with the lost of some opportunities that we tend to miss the new opportunities present to us. I have been lucky at my career. It has not been the smoothest of paths but I am happy with what chances and opportunities it has given me thus far. Its going to be a challenging year ahead.. time to work hard!

Anyway, I am seriously getting fatter. Weighing in at about 65 kg now, and it is definitely not muscle mass gained. Damn. Haha...

I am all of a sudden motivated once again to start exercising and whipping my body into shape once more. This feeling has came and gone for quite a few times in my life and I have to admit that each moment of burst it has at least forced me to keep in relatively decent shape which is a good thing. I have all too often let myself lose to the laziness. Well, how long will this new found momentum be able to carry itself? I doubt it will last more than a week or two to be honest, what with work getting in the way and all. I can't blame it on anything other than myself considering that there's a gym in the office but I hardly use it, more keen to head home instead of spending precious time there. Perhaps its a mentality that I should be changing. Let's see how the next few weeks take me.

So.. its time to train. And this is my geeky setup for jogging.
Bluetooth earphones linked up with a GPS phone that measures the distance + calories burnt of my run :) Everything connects easily and it just works (though some might say the initial setup is a PITA). Actually, knowing how far you run and how fast you run is a great motivator.
